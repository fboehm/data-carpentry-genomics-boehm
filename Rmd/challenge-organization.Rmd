```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Challenge 1

With the person next to you, discuss:

What kinds of data and information have you generated before you send your DNA/RNA off for sequencing?

## Challenge 1 answers

Types of files and information you have generated:

- spreadsheet or tabular data with the data from your experiment and whatever you were measuring for your study  
- lab notebook notes about how you conducted those experiments
spreadsheet or tabular data about the samples you sent off for sequencing. Sequencing centers often have a particular format they need with the name of the sample, DNA concentration and other information.  
- lab notebook notes about how you prepared the DNA/RNA for sequencing and what type of sequencing you’re doing, e.g. paired end Illumina HiSeq.   

*There likely will be other ideas here too. Was this more information and data than you were expecting?*

## Challenge 2

This is some potential spreadsheet data for an experiment being submitted for sequencing. The program bcl2fastq requires this spreadsheet to use as input to demultiplex the sequencing data into separate files, one per sample. With the person next to you, for about 2 minutes, discuss some of the problems with the spreadsheet data shown here.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height=400, out.width = 2000}
library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)
include_graphics("messy2.png")
```

## Challenge 2 answers


A full set of types of issues with spreadsheet data is at the Data Carpentry Ecology spreadsheet lesson. 

Not all are present in this example. The main problem is there are characters in the ids that aren’t allowed, e.g. “,”, “.”, “-“, “&” or spaces. 

Here is a “clean” version of the same spreadsheet:
